ggplot() +
  stamp_sf_countynorthcarolina(data = cars)
```

```

``` r


northcarolina_flat %>%
ggplot() +
aes(fips = FIPS, fill = SID74,
    label = paste0(NAME, "\n", SID74)) +
geom_sf_countynorthcarolina() +
geom_label_northcarolina_county(lineheight = .7,
size = 2, check_overlap= TRUE,
color = "oldlace")
#> Joining with `by = join_by(fips)`
